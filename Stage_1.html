							Programming involves 5 meta skills. They are <em>procedural
							thinking</em>, <em>abstract thinking</em>, <em>systems thinking</em>,
							<em>technological empathy</em>, and <em>debugging</em>.
						</p>
						<p>
							<em>Procedural thinking</em>
							is used to create unambiguous instructions
							for a computer to follow. It works in
							conjunction with <em>systems thinking</em>
							to break down a series of actions into
							smaller pieces that are easier to explain
							and code. These smaller pieces are then put
							together to create the complete solution for
							a problem.
						</p>
						<p>
							<em>Abstract thinking</em>
							involves the generalization between things
							that appear to be different. It is the
							recognition of patterns that exist across
							domains. Mathematics is one form of abstract
							thinking. For example the derivative has
							applications in both physics and economics.
						</p>
						<p>
							<em>Systems thinking</em>
							is used to break a problem down into it's
							component parts. It is used to slice and
							dice a problem down into smaller, more
							manageable pieces.
						</p>
						<p>
							<em>Technological Empathy</em>
							is the ability to understand technology,
							both it's strengths and weaknesses. For
							programmers this means understanding
							computers, how they work, what they are good
							at, and what they aren't.
						</p>
						<p>
							<em>Debugging</em>
							is the process of finding errors in a
							program. Both syntactic and semantic. It is
							the process a programmer uses to eliminate
							grammatical and logical errors from a
							program (failures to correctly communicate
							what a programmer wants to a computer).
							Computers are stupid, they cannot make
							guesses about a programmer's intended
							meaning. They can only execute the literal
							instructions that they were given.

					<div class="note_body">
						<p>
 							HTML documents are made up of <em>elements</em>.
 							They are the building blocks that, when combined,
 							create the structure of a web page.
						</p>
						<p>
 							An <em>element</em> usually consists of an opening tag
 							and closing tags. The opening tags often contain attributes
 							that define some property of the element. Void tags, such as
 							the line break tag, do not require a closing tag.
						</p>
						<p>
							<em>Elements</em> can be <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>.
							<em>Inline</em> elements exist on a line while <em>block</em>
							elements create a box that will hold the content.
						</p>
						<p>
							<em>Span</em> is an example of an <em>inline element</em> and
							<em>div</em> is an example of a <em>block element</em>. Each
							can take CSS class attributes that will define how they appear.
						</p>
						<p>
 							Two very important types of <em>attributes</em> are the <em>class</em>
 							and <em>ID attributes</em>. Both act as hooks that CSS and JavaScript
 							can use to identify specific elements or groups of elements so that they
 							can act on a web page.
						</p>
						<p> <!-- Some discussion of "Don't repeat yourself." -->
							<em>Class attributes</em> identify elements as an instance of a given
							class. They group elements together by style. Using them effectively
							can both drastically reduce the amount of code that needs to be
							written and the amount of bugs on a page. It also makes it much easier
							 to modify and debug a page. It enables developers to create a web
							 page <em>without repeating themselves.</em>
						</p>
						<p>
							It does this by allowing a developer to
							write one style definition that can then be
							applied to all elements that have that style
							attribute. All elements affected by that
							style will be affected by any changes made
							to it. Less code means less typos and other
							bugs when it is initially coded. It means
							less code to read and correct when
							debugging, and it reduces the opportunities
							for bugs to sneak in while it is being
							modified. Fewer bugs is a natural
							consequence of there being only one section
							of code that needs to be modified, instead
							of two, three, ten, or more to affect a
							change.
						</p>
						<p>
							<em>ID attributes</em> act as unique identifiers. They allow a developer
							to target a single element for modification by CSS or Javascript, as well
							as enabling the creation of links within a page. They must be unique or
							the file will not validate. The ability to use them as targets within a
							page is also dependent upon their uniqueness. If something needs modify
							more than a single element, use a class.
						</p>
						<p>
							A single element can have multiple classes.
							They are space delimited.

					<div class="note_body">
						<p>
							The structure of a page is controlled by the <em>DOM (Document
							Object Model)</em>. HTML defines the structure. While CSS defines
							the appearance of a page.
						</p>
						<p>
							<em>DOM</em> is a cross platform and language independent convention
							for representing and interaction with objects in mark up languages such
							as HTML. It generally has a tree like structure with many branching
							elements emerging from the root.
						</p>
						<p>
 							HTML uses a<em>box</em> model. Each box has several layers. The
 							central layer is the content of the box. It is enclosed by padding,
 							a border, and a margin.
						</p>
						<p>
 							The <em>content</em> is the nucleus of the element and contains
 							media of some kind, such as text or an image.
						</p>
						<p>
 							The <em>padding</em> clears an area around the content and is
 							affected by the background color of the box.
						</p>
						<p>
 							The <em>border</em> goes around the padding and content and
 							inherits the color property of the box.
						</p>
						<p>
 							The <em>margin</em> clears an area around the border and is
 							completely transparent. It is the space between the boxes.
						</p>
						<p>
 							The <em>element width</em> is equal to the total width of the
 							content, padding, and border. By setting the box sizing attribute
 							to border-box the calculation on element size will include both the
 							border and padding (not just the content). However, the margin is
 							not included.
						</p>
						<p>
 							The border-box attribute is a relatively recent addition to CSS
 							and so will not be supported by many older browsers. This can be
 							fixed by adding <em>browser specific prefixes</em>.
						</p>
						<p>
							<em>Element size</em> can be given in pixels or percentage of
							screen. If the size is set using pixels the element will not
							change size to accommodate itself to different screen sizes. If
							the element size is specified with percentages it will adapt itself
							automatically. Minimum and maximum screen sizes can also be specified.
						</p>
						<p>
 							The <em>flex-box</em> attribute will allow divs to appear next to each
 							other. They are used so that a page can dynamically resize and rearrange
 							itself in response to changes in size and orientation of the viewing area.
						</p>
						<p>
							When choosing a tag to use to create an element, the function of the element
							should be considered. While many block elements are syntactically similar, they
							carry different <em>semantic meanings</em>. Heading, section, article, aside,
							and nav tags are all examples of block tags with special semantic meanings.
						</p>
						<p>
 							When creating a web page the <em>Code</em>, <em>Test</em>, <em>Refine</em> cycle
 							is very effective. First the developer should consider the design of the page,
 							looking for natural boxes and repeated styles and semantic elements. Next they
 							should write their HTML code. Then apply styles working from the biggest structural
 							elements of the page to the smallest. Finally they should go back and compare their
 							results to the initial design, fixing any remaining minor details that may need
 							adjustment.
						</p>
						<p>
 							HTML and CSS should be <em>validated</em> before being published to the web. Code that
 							fails to validate fails to meet the standard specifications and may display differently
 							than intended, depending on a given browser's response to the code the faulty code.
 							HTML and CSS should be validated before being published to the web. Code that fails to

							<em>Cascading Style Sheets</em>
							(CSS) are used to style a web page. The term

							inherits the CSS property values from their
							ancestor elements.
						</p>
